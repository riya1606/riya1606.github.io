Employed Natural Language Processing techniques, including opinion mining and sentiment analysis, to identify and distinguish unique text styles and patterns. Explored language models such as N-grams, n-gram-based, and Hidden Markov Models for text classification. Took a proactive role in training and optimizing deep learning models for text classification, involving RNNs and CNNs, and transformer models such as BERT and GPT.</p>"}
