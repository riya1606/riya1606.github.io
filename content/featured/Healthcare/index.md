Under the guidance of Prof. Jayakumar K., an in-depth study was conducted to explore the wide-ranging applications of machine learning in healthcare. This encompassed a detailed literature review and technological analysis, involving extensive research on state-of-the-art applications, including Cancer Detection, Diabetes Detection, Heart Disease, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Parkinsonâ€™s Disease. Various machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, were explored, and tests were conducted to assess model performance. The project aimed to contribute to the understanding of machine learning's diverse applications in healthcare, laying the groundwork for advancements in medical diagnostics and treatment.
