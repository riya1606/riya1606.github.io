Collaborated with Prof. Radhika Mamidi at the Language Technologies Research Centre, IIIT-Hyderabad on a research project focused on classifying text styles as either feminine or masculine. Employed Natural Language Processing techniques, including opinion mining and sentiment analysis, to identify and distinguish unique text styles and patterns. Explored language models such as N-grams, n-gram-based, and Hidden Markov Models for text classification. Took a proactive role in training and optimizing deep learning models for text classification, involving RNNs and CNNs, and transformer models such as BERT and GPT.
